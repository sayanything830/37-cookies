This is an application that allows a user to sign up and/or sign in, then redirects the user to their dashboard.

Currently, the user must sign up at:
```
localhost:8080/welcome/signup
```

Then the user needs to navigate to:
```
localhost:8080/welcome/signin
```

This will then redirect the user to their dashboard. At this point, a second user may sign up and will be automatically redirected to the dashboard, but not on the initial user sign up.

Once a user has been signed in or signed up, they may navigate to the dashboard at any time. If a user attempts to access the dashboard for the first time, the dashboard route will redirect the user to the signup route.

Dashboard route:
```
localhost:8080/dashboard
```
